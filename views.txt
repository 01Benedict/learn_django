# Handling ListView

ListView is a built-in classbase view for listing items of a model to a template

model -- > The model who's objects will be retrieve
template_name -- > The html file that will display the list
context_object_name -- > The name representing how the objects will be called.

View Syntax

class YourClassName(ListView):
    model = YourModelName
    template_name = "path/to/yourTemplateName.html"
    context_object_name = "name"

Urls
from app.views import YourClassName

urlpatterns = [
    path('pathName', YourClassName.as_view(), name='yourPathName')
]

pathName -- > The name to be displayed in the url of the browser
Eg: www.mytodo.com/tasks

where pathName = tasks
YourClassName.as_view() -- > The name of your view to be rendered
name -- > how the url path will be called inside an html template tag

Template tags will be discused later...
